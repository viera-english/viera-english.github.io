Podemos preguntar y negar algo usando adjetivos demostrativos, usando la misma formula que aprendimos con el verbo **To Be**.

  ```html
Afirmativo: This is a police officer
Pregunta: Is this a police officer?
Respuesta afirmativa: Yes, this is a police officer
Respuesta negativa: No, this isn't a police officer

Afirmativo: These are my friends.
Pregunta: Are these your friends?
Respuesta afirmativa: Yes, these are my friends.
Respuesta negativa: No, these aren't my friends, because these are my uncles.
```
