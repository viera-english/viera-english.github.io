This is my friend Wendy. Every day, se wakes up at 5:00 am, when the alarm rings.

She gets up 5 minutes later and takes a shower. Every day. she gets dressed in her bedroom and then she goes to the kitchen.

She prepares the breakfast with her husband George and she has breakfast with her family.

They don't drink milk, because they like orange juice.

She goes to work at 7:30am, she works from 8:00 to 12:00
